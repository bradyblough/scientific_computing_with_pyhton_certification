# Scientific Computing with Python 
Certificate Course from freecodecamp.org

This repository includes challenge problems developed for the Scientific Computing with Python certificate on freecodecamp.org. All of these problems were completed successfully.

## Problem 1: Arithmetic Formatter

**File:** arithmetic_arranger.py

**Description:** Implements a function `arithmetic_arranger()` that formats and arranges arithmetic problems vertically and side-by-side. The function handles addition and subtraction problems, follows specific formatting rules, and includes error handling.

## Problem 2: Budget Tracker

**File:** budget.py

**Description:** Defines a `Category` class with methods for budget management, including deposit, withdrawal, transfer, balance checking, and creating a bar chart of spending percentages. A function `create_spend_chart` generates a bar chart based on spending categories.

## Problem 3: Shape Calculator

**File:** shape_calculator.py

**Description:** Implements two classes, `Rectangle` and `Square`, using object-oriented programming. The classes handle geometric calculations such as area, perimeter, diagonal, and can be used to create shapes and perform various operations.

## Problem 4: Time Calculator

**File:** time_calculator.py

**Description:** Implements a function `add_time()` that adds a duration to a given start time, considering the 12-hour clock format. It also handles optional starting days of the week, displaying the result along with the day of the week and the number of days later if applicable.


## Project 5: Probability Calculator

**File:** prob_calculator.py

**Description:** Defines a `Hat` class for conducting probability experiments. It simulates drawing balls from a hat, calculating the probability of certain outcomes based on a specified number of experiments. The `experiment` function performs the experiments and returns the estimated probability.

## Development and Testing

- For each project, the code is developed in the respective Python file.
- Unit tests are available in `test_module.py` for verification.
